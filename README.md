# ScreenRotator+ Unity on 18.04
Small applet based on henrysting's (great work, thanks!) ScreenRotator+ (https://github.com/henrysting/ScreenRotator). 
The modification are only in the backlight control, which is using brightnessctl instead of xbacklight.

You can install it by running:
```
sudo apt install brightnessctl
```
